                <p class="font-bold">Objective:</p>
                <p>To have highest number of points on the board at the end of a set.</p>

                <p class="font-bold">Key terms:</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>1.Stones: these are the movable playing pieces.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/Stones/stone-1.png" class="w-20 m-auto">
                <p>2.Tiles: these are the areas where a stone can be placed on the board. There are 76 tiles in total.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/how to play/tiles.png" class="w-24 m-auto">
                <p>3.Row: a row is a diagonal group of tiles.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/how to play/row.png" class="w-24 m-auto">
                <p>4.Winning Row: if you have more stones than the other player in any given row, that row is called a winning row.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/how to play/winning-row.png" class="w-24 m-auto">
                <p>5.Stale Row: a stale row is a row that has an equal number of stones from both players.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/how to play/stale-row.png" class="w-24 m-auto">
                <p>6.Empty Row: an empty row has no stones from either team.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/how to play/row.png" class="w-24 m-auto">
                <p>7.Dead Zone: the sections of the board that are darker. If a stone is here, then it will not be counted as a stone. This could mean that what was a winning row, is now stale.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/how to play/dead-zone.png" class="w-24 m-auto">
                <p>8.Move: you must shift one stone to the end of its row, or up against another stone already in that row, and that is one move. Moves can be undone if they were made in the current turn (and if it is still your turn) â€“ just click the undo button.</p>
                <img src="/diagon/assets/how to play/move.png" class="h-24 m-auto">
                <p>9.Turn: The number of turns will be between 1-5, depending on the stage of the game. The other player cannot move their stones during your turn.</p>
                <img src="">
                <p>10.Set: the end of a set is the only time when the scores will be counted resulting in a win or loss. A set ends when both players have had a turn with their 1 move.</p>
                <img src="">
            </div>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 justify-center text-center text-2xl p-10 gap-10">
                <p class="font-bold">Basic Movements:</p>
                <p>To move, click on the stone you would like to move, and then click on the highlighted square you would like to move it to. You can also drag your stone of choice to a highlighted tile. Stones can only be moved to the end of their row or up to another stone.</p>
                <p class="font-bold">Scoring:</p>
                <p>Scores are tallied up by finding which player has the most winning rows. For each winning row a player has, they earn a point. A stale row and an empty row will not result in any points for either team.</p>
